This C project is designed to process and analyze airline route data from a CSV file, focusing on the number of passengers traveling between various airports. It begins by dynamically allocating an array of `RouteRecord` structs, each of which stores information about a route, such as the origin, destination, airline code, and monthly passenger counts across nine months. The program reads and parses the CSV file line by line, storing unique route entries and aggregating passenger data per month if duplicate routes are found. A recursive search function (`findAirlineRoute`) helps identify existing records to avoid duplication. Users can search the data based on route, origin, destination, or airline, with the program printing matches and summarizing statistics such as total passengers, monthly breakdowns, and average monthly passengers. The project emphasizes dynamic memory management, data parsing, and basic data aggregation using structured records.
